# Machine_Learning_Project

In this project, different algorithms of classification methods such as SVM, Decision Tree, etc are applied to the huge dataset and the predicted result is calculated as per the requirements. Predicting the output is mainly calculated based on the accuracy with the help of the Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Logloass for the particular algorithm respectively.
