# Machine_Learning_Project for the loan dataset.

In this project, different algorithms of classification methods such as SVM, Decision Tree, etc are applied to the loan dataset and the output is predicted. The output is mainly calculated based on the accuracy with the help of Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Logloass for the particular algorithms respectively.
The accuracy for the dataset  is approximately between 70%-75% for all the different algorithms been performed.
